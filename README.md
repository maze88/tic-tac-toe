# Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game for the command line, made as part of a Python exercise, from when I begun learning.
I have uploaded it and am re-visiting it in order to share as an example with friends who are learning programming too.
The initial change to the code since it was originally written is adapting it to work with Python3.
